B-Audio
An interactive interface designed for contactless full-body interaction with audio and video in a web browser. 

Embodied design methodologies are applied to conceptualize and develop a system for live audio-visual interaction. 

# P5js and Posenet
Javascript based libraries were used to enable pose detection in the browser and implement graphics functionality

# Express
An express server was used to communicate with the webpage and send data to MAX-MSP audio synthesis software. Socket.io was used for client-server communications.

# Node for MAX
Nodejs and MAX were connected using Node for MAX

# Demo 
This [video presentation](https://youtu.be/ZdYopVIa_oE) shows an overview of the design and demonstration of the system
